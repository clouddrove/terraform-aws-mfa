We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-mfa/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
# use this
    module "mfa" {
    source        = "clouddrove/mfa/aws"
    version       = "0.15.0"
    name          = "mfa"
    environment   = "test"
    users         = []
    groups        = []     
   
    }
  
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| Policy | The policy in json | `any` | `""` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| groups | enable MFA for the members in these groups | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| label\_order | label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `test` or `mfa`). | `string` | n/a | yes |
| path | The path of the policy in MFA. | `string` | `"/"` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-mfa"` | no |
| users | enable MFA for these users | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| iam-arn | The ARN assigned by AWS to this policy. |
| tags\_all | Additional tags e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`) |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
